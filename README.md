# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes customer behavior to identify patterns that lead to churn (when customers stop using a service). It uses historical data and machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, helping businesses take action to retain valuable clients.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze customer data to understand why customers leave.
- Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy – data handling  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib – data visualization  
- Scikit-learn – machine learning  
- (Optional) XGBoost or LightGBM – advanced models  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔑 Project Steps

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Load dataset
   - Understand feature definitions and distributions

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., TotalCharges)
   - Convert categorical to numerical (Label Encoding or One-Hot)
   - Normalize numeric features

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Churn rate by gender, contract type, tenure
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Visualize class imbalance

4. **Model Building**
   - Train/test split
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost
   - Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

5. **Insights**
   - Identify major churn factors
   - Recommend strategies to reduce churn (e.g., flexible contracts, better customer support)
